Net::HTTPServer v0.1

This is a light weight HTTP server that serves files as well as attaching
function calls to URL requests.  This allows you to do a lot of things:

- embed the web server into your program and serve up
  anything your program can do

- make a file available for download that you created

- just take you CGI program and turn it into a stand
  alone HTTP server that you can run on any machine.

- lots lots more

STATUS

  This is the first release.  I built this for a couple of side projects I
wanted to tackle, and wanted to make it available to everyone.  Please give
me feedback.  I would love to make this more and more feature rich, while
still keeping it light weight.
