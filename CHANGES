  - Fixed IO::Socket::SSL interface problem.  Accessing multiple pages
    would result in SSL errors about not having a context.  The lesson
    for the day is: Forking does weird things.  In this case it
    *appears* that the SSL part of the socket was being closed when we
    sent the web page.  Much reading shows us the SSL_no_shutdown option
    to close does not shutdown the SSL.  This seems to fix the problem.
  - Reworked forking inner loop.  There were some performance issues.

0.6.5
=====
  - Removed a rogue debug statement.

0.6
===
  - Added code to detect a failed Start() and throw errors if Process()
    was called.
  - Fixed problem where a failed Start() would cause Stop() to crater
    since the socket and selects might be undefined.

0.5
===
  - Fixed bug with SSL support.  I had hard coded paths and a bad check
    for the SSL options.

0.4
===
  - Allow for the reponse to be a FileHandle that _send will read and send
    in one go.  This should make serving files faster (at least big files).
  - Fixed typo and mistake in logic with IO::Socket::SSL check.
  
0.3
===
  - Fixed logic to check for IO::Socket::SSL (didn't work very well with
    Perl2Exe).
  - Added tests for make test.
  
0.2
===
  - Fixed bug in read code where it would not finish reading a request.
  - If IO::Socket::SSL is installed, you can run a secure server.
  - Added a preforking server type "forking" (default is "single").  You can
    confiugre the number of child processes via the numproc config option.

0.1
===
  - Auto-find the mime.types in the module directories.
  - Port scanning for embeded on the fly servers.
  - Redirects directories without / to same dir with /:  foo/bar -> foo/bar/
  - Lists directories
  - Serves files
  - Allow for registering of functions to URLs so that it gets called when
    the URL is requested.
